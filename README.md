# FinFET_SRAM_Aging_effects
Exploring aging and power effects of TEI on FinFET based SRAM cells


# As the semiconductor technology has evolved from planar to FinFET technology, power and aging related constraints have become more significant than ever. Due to stagnation of threshold voltage scaling, Temperature Effect Inversion (TEI) is prominent in FinFETs, which means that higher temperature is more favorable for achieving higher speeds, in case of both core and cache memories. However, this can adversely affect in terms of power consumption and reliability due to aging. This directly translates to degradation of Signal-to-Noise Margin (SNM) in SRAM cells. In this paper, we evaluate the above power and aging concerns so that optimal Voltage and frequency levels can be chosen for higher reliability.


For measuring the SNM, we use the setup proposed by seevinck et al. and find the side of the maximum square that can be fit in the butterfly curves. The simulation setup that we use is as below:
